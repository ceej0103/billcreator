# BILLCREATOR - Session Summary

## Project Overview
BILLCREATOR is a full-stack web application for managing water usage data, generating bills, and automating data fetching from SimpleSub. The application uses Node.js/Express backend with React frontend, SQLite database, and Puppeteer for web scraping.

## Current Status (Latest Session)

### ✅ Completed Features
1. **Production-Ready Auto Data Fetch System**
   - Automated daily fetching at 5:00 AM Eastern Time
   - Fetches 65 days of data (current date minus 1 day)
   - Server-side logging system with 7-day retention
   - Automatic CSV file cleanup after processing (ENABLED)
   - Manual fetch button for testing purposes

2. **Database Viewer**
   - Matrix format display (dates as rows, units as columns)
   - Shows most recent 65 days of actual data from database
   - Independent of fetch process (uses MAX(date) from water_usage table)
   - Proper error handling and debugging

3. **Log Viewer**
   - Daily log files stored in dedicated folder
   - 7-day retention with automatic cleanup
   - Web interface to view log contents

4. **Create Bills Tab UI Improvements**
   - Restructured layout with stacked date fields on left, billing info on right
   - Navigation arrows positioned next to "Start Date" label
   - Auto-population of data when date range is selected
   - Previous month comparison logic fixed
   - Assumed date range: 2 months back from current month
   - **NEW: Balance Update Feature** - Large checkboxes on each bill to update tenant balances

5. **Authentication & Security**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Protected API endpoints
   - Secure token storage

### ✅ Completed Debugging Work
**Database Viewer Issue**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Timezone conversion issue fixed

**Root Cause**: JavaScript's `new Date('2025-08-13')` was interpreting dates as UTC midnight, causing timezone conversion to show previous day.

**Solution**: Added `T00:00:00` to force local time interpretation: `new Date('2025-08-13T00:00:00')`

**Result**: Database viewer now correctly displays 8/13/2025 as the first date in the table.

**Champion Doubling Logic**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Missing property field fixed

**Root Cause**: Bill generation data was missing the `property` field needed for Champion doubling logic.

**Solution**: Added `property: unit.property` to the bill data sent to the server.

**Result**: Champion units now correctly receive double per-day charges.

**Address Display Issues**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - All addresses corrected

**Root Cause**: Database initialization had incorrect addresses (using "St" instead of "Avenue", "Road", "Drive").

**Solution**: Updated `init-db.js` with correct addresses from server.js.

**Result**: All properties now display correct addresses in Update Tenants and Update Balances tabs.

**CSV Cleanup**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Re-enabled automatic cleanup

**Root Cause**: CSV cleanup was disabled for testing purposes.

**Solution**: Uncommented the cleanup code in server.js.

**Result**: Downloaded CSV files are now automatically deleted after processing.

**Authentication Redirect Bug**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Proper redirect on session expiration

**Root Cause**: When JWT token expired, users were stuck on protected routes instead of being redirected to login.

**Solution**: 
- Modified axios interceptor to redirect to root path instead of reloading
- Added token verification on app startup
- Added `/api/verify-token` endpoint
- Added manual logout functionality

**Result**: Users are now properly redirected to login page when session expires, and can manually logout.

### 📋 Pending Tasks
1. **Final Testing**
   - Test balance update feature functionality
   - Verify Champion doubling logic works correctly
   - Test CSV cleanup functionality
   - Verify all addresses display correctly

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy to Render
   - Test all functionality in production environment
   - Verify automated scheduling works
   - Monitor daily data fetching

3. **Documentation Review**
   - Verify all documentation is current and accurate
   - Update any deployment-specific instructions
   - Final code review
